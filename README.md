## Hi, I'm Devon 👋

I've been a professional full-stack software engineer for 5 years and been programming since I was a teenager. 👨‍💻

So far I've worked in the healthcare space. It's been fun to team up with smart people in a vertical I didn't know anything about, building new solutions to overdue problems. It's been a thrill to leverage my web development skills to tackle business challenges. 💡

I've led initiatives and owned projects, collaborated across teams and departments, and mentored developers under me. I take pride in the individual work that I produce, but I'm also passionate about being someone people want to work with. To me, that means thoughtful communication, being available, a strong work ethic, and dependability. 🤝

I just enjoy what I do, and I look forward to opportunities to apply my skillset towards business goals and continuing to learn more about my craft in the process. 🙌

### Personal Projects
I like to make productivity and learning applications. I make tools that I use myself.
* [deep-note](https://github.com/devonbahary/deep-note)
    * I have a lot of ideas. I like to keep my day-to-day thoughts organized as well. [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) wasn't doing it for me.
* [ffxi-crafting](https://github.com/devonbahary/ffxi-crafting)
    * I even made a productivity app for my online videogame. 😂
* [noteable](https://github.com/devonbahary/noteable)
    * A collaborative space to record ideas across different topics.
* [Macrotrac](https://github.com/devonbahary/macrotrac-redux)
    * What did I eat today?
* [Scholarly](https://github.com/devonbahary/scholarly)
    * Don't just look up words you don't know and then forget about them. Commit them to memory with practice.
* Quotable
    * Use image-to-text to capture quotes from the books you're reading and get a push notification every day to remind you of what you read a year ago.

I've also dabbled in game development, including trying to create [my own 2D physics engine](https://github.com/devonbahary/2d-physics). 🎮
